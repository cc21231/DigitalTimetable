### Download For Other Operating Systems

This project was developed for windows, and I currently have no way to test the program's functionality on other platforms.

When running on a non-Windows system, the following feature(s) will be disabled:
-	The `resolution_scaling` options in settings (Note: this may cause display issues that need to be accounted for by adjusting the `ui_scaling` option)
